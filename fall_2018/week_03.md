## This Week's Plan

This week's plan is to communicate with other members on implementing the database in Django.

Get DB design approved by other group members. Created electronic copy for reference, and start figuring out how to implement DB.

> Examples: New Bugs to be fixed, Design choices

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

A possible hurdle that could be coming up is implementing RPI CAS with our database. We have not reached that point yet, however.

> Examples: Confusion on how to approach a problem, Limited experience with a specific technology
