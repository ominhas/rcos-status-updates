## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

Went to the bonus session as we usually do on Wednesday to meet up with the group to flesh out what needs to be done. Updated my local system and made sure everything was working as intended. Gave feedback on the frontend design. Noted how it's important to make sure that the site is mobile-friendly (important in modern sites).

> Examples:
> Bug fixes, Features added, Links to Issues, Links to Pull-Requests, Lightning Talks, Bonus Sessions

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

My goals are the same as last week. More "finishing touches" to end the semester. My actual commits have been spare because I took on a more advisory role than I usually do in this project.

There are two main things I want to get done before the semester end:
- Look over all the code. Is there anything that's confusing? Try to write up better documentation for it.
- Continue to research how to get a proper database view.

> Examples: New Bugs to be fixed, Design choices

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

I don't want to make useless commits, but I feel like if I don't make any more commits that may lower my grade. I'll probably talk to a few people about it. 

> Examples: Confusion on how to approach a problem, Limited experience with a specific technology

## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.
