## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

Test the database by looking through it with some kind of database viewer. Currently using phpmyadmin might be a good idea. I'll have to look into it. BUt the point of it is to make sure that our Django model looks as we want it to.

> Examples: New Bugs to be fixed, Design choices

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

School work is starting to pick up a lot, and I'm finding less time to work on this project. I'm planning to make more time on weekends, but unfortunately I don't see any sign of schoolwork slowing down.

> Examples: Confusion on how to approach a problem, Limited experience with a specific technology
