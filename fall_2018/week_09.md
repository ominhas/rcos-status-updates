## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

Made commits to a certain branch on the repo along with a PR. My changes involved styling the code in a way that is more readable. For example, tabs were extensively used in the old code, which can look strange depending on how many spaces your text editor uses for a tab. Other things were changed, including making sure a single line did not have too much text, and that the spaces in between functions were not made in an awkward way.

I've also done research on both the old repository, which allowed me to view info of how the database was organized before, and a lot of Django research.

Had a good semester, I learned a lot of things, but I did not get to do as much as I wanted to because of other classes.
