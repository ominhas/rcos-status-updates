## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

I had so many tests and projects, I barely had time to work on Petitions unfortunately. I did do some brainstorming on what I can work on for the next few weeks, which I'll explain in the next section. Getting my head around Django is confusing, which is annoying me, because I feel like I should be way more familiar with it at this point.

> Examples:
> Bug fixes, Features added, Links to Issues, Links to Pull-Requests, Lightning Talks, Bonus Sessions

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

There are two main things I want to get done before the semester end:
- Look over all the code. Is there anything that's confusing? Try to write up better documentation for it.
- Continue to research how to get a proper database view.

> Examples: New Bugs to be fixed, Design choices

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

Django! It's strangely hard to find certain documentation on it? One of our group members used a Django function ManytoField, which I can't seem to find anything on. I'm actually not sure if it's even a thing, so I'll double check with that group member. It's also getting confusing to me how Django is interacting with the database, how it stores stuff, etc. Really wanna know how that works.

> Examples: Confusion on how to approach a problem, Limited experience with a specific technology
